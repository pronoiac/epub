# epub to markdown converter

## About
This converts an epub file to markdown.

## Installation
I'm running this locally instead of as a gem.

```
gem install bundle
bundle
```

## Usage
The epub filename is required.
```
bundle exec epubinfo.rb [doc.epub]
```

It currently emits all the markdown to stdout.
